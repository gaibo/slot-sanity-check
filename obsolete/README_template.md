# First-level heading

Very cool

<!-- This comment will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->

Lists - can use any of the following symbols:
- George Washington using -
* John Adams using *
+ Thomas Jefferson using +
- ^ All of those above rendered the same
4) Can do ordered list by just using number; it shows **4.** even if I write **4)** which is kind of ~~annoying~~ yup *annoying* oh and I'll probably use _ underscores to do _italics_ instead of * asterisks, i.e.
   - **Did this list line _nest properly_ or no???**
   - testing
     - test ooh this changes the bullet!
       - how about this one?
         - how about this?
   1. How about this one?
   2. Now?
      1. Now?
      2. Less space than the unindented list lines I see
      3. And note that switching between unordered and ordered incurs that space

## Second-level heading

> Very cool (quote)

Just one command of `code`

```
code block!
code block second line!
```

`#ffffff` for light mode and `#000000` for dark mode
- GitHub has fancy color support that adds color notes to the above code commands

Task Lists (this is obviously only rendered in GitHub):
- [ ] Task that's not done
- [x] Task that is done!
- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue

### Third-level heading

Very cool

You can do emoji like :shipit: or :+1:. Looks like this renders only in GitHub.

Can we do a link? Make [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) a hyperlink.

[^1]: My reference in the footnote. This is a GitHub exclusive I think. I think GitHub would render this at the very end regardless this being center of page.

#### Fourth-level heading

This is GitHub-specific picture-theming - should show moon for their dark theme, sun for light theme. Offline, I just see the sun.

##### Fifth-level heading

At this point the heading is smaller than the body text lol.
