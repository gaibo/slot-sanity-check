This script aims to speed up folder/file renaming necessary to change the
effective character slot of Smash Ultimate mods. Note this won't automatically
work for every mod - textures for some characters like Wario won't work if
transferred from even slot to odd slot, etc.

As a blackbox script, we'll try to be non-destructive and explicit by:
1) creating duplicate folder instead of modifying in existing folder,
2) pretty printing everything staged to be "renamed" (not technically renaming
   since we'll create new files with the name) as sanity check before executing.
This script will NOT change any of your existing files! And if it fails,
rest easy knowing nothing on your computer has been deleted - there may be a
new temporary folder that you can safely delete!

The script will have 2 somewhat standalone features:
1) slot "verification" (run script without specifying new slot):
   I'll somewhat rudely require you to include the slot in the name of the mod
   source folder, e.g. script will reject "cool_falcon_mod" until you rename it
   "cool_falcon_mod_c00" or "C00". This is honestly just best practice for
   everyone involved; note if your mod spans multiple slots, it shouldn't need
   this script in the first place because this script is for changing one
   numbered slot to another.
   Anyway, I'll use this slot info to sanity check the naming of all files and
   folders included in the mod, and I'll also check the fighter code name and
   maybe even config.json. You'd be surprised how often mods are published
   broken, or containing accidental unrelated files!
   Since verification is completely harmless, I've also built in "batch
   verification", i.e. if you point the script at a folder (no naming
   requirement) containing a bunch of mod folders, it will try to run its normal
   verfication on each mod subfolder.
2) slot "renaming" (run script with the new slot argument):
   The new slot mod folder I generate will be named following your source folder
   formatting. Yet another reason we'll require the source folder to include
   the mod slot in its name!

Here is a brainstorming list of folders/files that should be modified to slot
(this is not "theoretically" complete, but practically over the hundreds of
 mods I use, these are the folders/files with slot-specific names):
- camera/fighter/<fighter_code>/c0X/ -> c0Y
- effect/fighter/<fighter_code>/ef_<fighter_code>_c0X.eff -> c0Y
                               /trail_c0X/ -> c0Y
                               /model/<*very_specific_effect>_c0X/c00/ -> c0Y
- fighter/<fighter_code>/model/body/c0X/ -> c0Y
                              /<*warioman_nikita_etc>/c0X/ -> c0Y
                        /motion/c0X/ -> c0Y
- sound/bank/fighter_voice/vc_<fighter_code>_c0X.* -> c0Y
            /fighter/se_<fighter_code>_c0X.* -> c0Y
- ui/replace/chara/chara_[0-13]/chara_[0-13]_<fighter_code>_0X -> 0Y
    /message/msg_name.xmsbt -> could edit 00 to 01, etc. but number not standard
    /param/ui_chara_db.prcxml -> ideally don't change, because can't change prcx
- config.json -> edit declared file additions; just check that new slot is there

The above list assumes the mod is designed for one slot number, and that you
would not concurrently set the same mod on multiple slots (you could, but we're
keeping files (e.g. vc_narration_characall.nus3audio, msg_name.msbt) that will
lead to Arcropolis "file conflict", i.e. one slot's mod files take questionable
precendence over another's, because only one can be "active". You can fix file
conflicts by simply renaming the file you'd prefer to deactivate.
Some other renaming notes off the top of my head:
- item/ subfolder slots should not be renamed, e.g. to modify Snake's items,
  the new textures must be c00.
- I'm not sure whether to rename Kirby Cap folders included with other fighters.
  Probably not, because we want Kirby's C00 costumes to change, right?
  fighter/kirby/model/copy_<fighter_code>_cap/c0X/ -> c0Y???
- There is no one-slot solution (yet) for character selection screen announcer
  voice lines. Right now, you have to replace the whole audio file at
  sound/bank/narration/vc_narration_characall.nus3audio
- ui/replace/chara/ subfolders must accomodate numbers 0 to 13; though most
  mods don't go past 6, you may need to go to 10 for Pokemon Trainer, 12 for
  boss portraits, 13 for Joker.
  Character UI:
    *- chara_0 = record portrait (square face)
    *- chara_1 = CSS(character select screen)/boxing ring portrait (square,
                 character most in bottom right)
    *- chara_2 = stock icon (square cartoon icon)
    *- chara_3 = vs./results portrait (square, character full in bottom left)
    *- chara_4 = battle portrait (square face in diamond)
    - chara_5 = spirit portrait (no alts)
    *- chara_6 = final smash portrait (1:2 horizontal rectangle, eyes)
    - chara_7 = CSS icon (no alts)
    - chara_10 = Pokemon Trainer pokemon masks
    - chara_12 = boss portraits
    - chara_13 = alternate battle portrait for unmasked Joker
- ui/message/msg_name.msbt and ui/param/ui_chara_db.prc are often changed in
  mods to .xmsbt and .prcxml (or .prcx) to take advantage of Arcropolis's
  "param patching" which allows for one-slot text (really hope a similar system
  is invented for announcer voice lines). Editing these files to appropriately
  change active slots of character names may be tricky. Please sanity check
  by reading WataPascul's or Miguel's fantastic guides.
  - Technically we could be very intrusive and edit numbers in .prcxml,
    then edit corresponding numbers in .xmsbt. We could even link in code to
    generate the param patching files by diffing non-one-slotted MSBT and PRC
    with parcel.exe. But that would be a lot of effort for something not a lot
    of people would use, I think.
